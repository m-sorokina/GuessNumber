**Short description**  
This is a simple Java console application that guesses a number youâ€™re thinking of between 1 and 1000 using a binary search algorithm.  
The program asks to think of a number between 1 and 1000.  
It then repeatedly asks whether the number is greater than a guessed number.  
Based on "y" (yes) or "n" (no) responses, it narrows down the range.  
The program continues until it correctly guesses the number.  

Consol output
```
Select the number within range from 1 to 1000

Is your number greater 256 (y/n) : y
Is your number greater 384 (y/n) : n
Is your number greater 320 (y/n) : n
Is your number greater 288 (y/n) : y
Is your number greater 304 (y/n) : n
Is your number greater 296 (y/n) : y
Is your number greater 300 (y/n) : y
